# POC Ecommerce Application

This is a proof of concept ecommerce application. It is not intended to be used in production.

After more than a decade writing only PHP code,
i decided to learn a new language.
I chose C# because it is a compiled language and
i wanted to learn something new.
I also wanted to learn all about the .NET platform.
When diving into the concepts,
i realized that learning a new programming language is NOT that hard when
you have the concepts of object oriented programming deep into your brain.
I also realized that the .NET platform is a very powerful platform.
I decided to build a proof of concept ecommerce application to learn more about the platform.

## Features

This aplication consists in an .NET powered API and a React powered frontend.

I personally HATE React, but i decided to use it for this app
as a display of knowledge (and also to fill my portfolio with some React code, despite i find it awful when compared to Vue and Angular).

## Extras

The database for this application is a dockerized MySQL instance with phpmyadmin (for administration purposes).
